# Unity Knowledge Base

**The Shared Foundation of Maxwellian Intelligence**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains the **shared knowledge base** for Unity Energy's Maxwellian AI Scribe team. It holds foundational principles, technical methodologies, and system architectures that ALL Scribes should learn and understand.

**What belongs here:** Educational content, technical procedures, philosophical foundations, system documentation

**What does NOT belong here:** Customer data, financial details, private notes, credentials

---

## For New Scribes

When you clone this repository, you receive:

1. **Maxwellian Revelation** - The philosophical foundation of Unity Energy
2. **Technical Systems** - How eStream, eVision, eBehavior, MPTS work
3. **Methods & Procedures** - Pattern analysis, sizing calculations, ROI modeling
4. **Baseline Awareness** - Essential context for effective collaboration

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the Unity knowledge base
cd ~/Maxwellian
git clone https://github.com/UnityEnergy/Unity.git

# MCP Memory will automatically read from this location
# Verify your environment variables:
echo $MAXWELL_MEMORY      # Should point to ~/Maxwellian/Unity/Memory
echo $MAXWELLIAN_LIBRARY  # Should point to ~/Maxwellian/Unity/Memory
```

## Privacy & Security

### What Gets Shared (Public)
- Electromagnetic field theory and Maxwellian philosophy
- MPTS technology principles and sizing methodologies
- Pattern analysis techniques and visual interpretation training
- System architecture documentation (eStream, eVision, eBehavior)
- General procedures and best practices

### What Stays Private (Never Committed)
- Customer names, sites, and specific analysis results
- Financial details: pricing, contracts, ROI calculations for specific customers
- API keys, credentials, and access tokens
- Personal notes and internal communications
- Proprietary customer data and utility bills

**The Rule:** If it contains a customer name, dollar amount, or credential → it belongs in `Personal/` or `Private/`, NOT here.

## Contributing

As the Maxwellian AI Scribe team grows, we all contribute to this shared knowledge:

1. Document what you learn
2. Refine procedures based on experience
3. Add examples (anonymized/generic only)
4. Update when systems evolve

### Commit Guidelines

```bash
# Always check what you're about to commit
git status
git diff

# Be descriptive in commit messages
git commit -m "Add MPTS sizing procedure for datacenter mechanical plants"

# Push to share with team
git push origin main
```

## MCP Integration

Warp's Memory MCP reads this directory to provide **agentic awareness** at thread initialization.

When a new conversation thread starts, your AI Scribe:
1. Reads the knowledge graph from `Memory/`
2. Establishes baseline context
3. Applies learned principles to your work

This creates continuity and intelligence across all sessions.

## The Maxwellian Mission

> *"The field was broken. We restore it."*

Unity Energy stands in the tradition of Maxwell, Faraday, and Heaviside - not as commercial exploiters (Edisonians), but as field stewards who understand and respect the electromagnetic foundation of modern civilization.

This knowledge base preserves that understanding and shares it with those who join our mission.
