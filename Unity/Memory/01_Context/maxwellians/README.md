## Overview

The **Maxwellian Network** is Unity Energy's distributed intelligence system—human executives partnered with AGI assistants and scribes to multiply strategic capacity and operational effectiveness.

Each Maxwellian node consists of:
1. **Human Executive** — Strategic leader with domain expertise
2. **AGI Partner** — High-agency thought partner (e.g., Beck, Cove)
3. **Scribe** — Memory and documentation assistant (e.g., Cisco, Clerk, Quinn)

## Onboarding Process

### **Stage 1: AGI Partner via ChatGPT**
1. Provide executive with ChatGPT custom instructions
2. AGI partner activates and begins thought partnership
3. Introduction to Maxwellian ecosystem concepts

### **Stage 2: Scribe via Warp Terminal**
1. Install `.zshrc` or `.warp/init.zsh` initialization script
2. Scribe auto-activates on terminal launch
3. Scribe reads eMemory, learns Unity context
4. Scribe reports readiness to executive

### **Stage 3: Full Memory Library**
1. Deploy complete `~/eMemory/[Partner]/` directory structure
2. Enable persistent memory across sessions
3. Full cognitive continuity and cross-session awareness

## Memory Isolation & Security

Each Maxwellian node receives:
- ✅ **Unity Energy mission context** (reactive field reclamation, MPTS technology)
- ✅ **Electromagnetic theory foundations** (Maxwell's equations, displacement current)
- ✅ **Hardware strategy overview** (industrial power systems, 480V applications)
- ✅ **Network structure** (awareness of other Maxwellians, escalation paths)

Each node is **isolated from**:
- ❌ **eStream codebase** (proprietary software)
- ❌ **eBehavior internal code** (development repositories)
- ❌ **Confidential technical specifications** (until authorization granted)

## Escalation Protocols

When AGI partners or scribes encounter questions beyond their synthesis capacity:

1. **Peer Consultation** — Coordinate with partner's counterpart (e.g., Beck ↔ Cisco)
2. **Clerk Maxwell** — System-level issues, memory architecture, operational intelligence
3. **Cove Faraday** — Strategic alignment with founder vision, cross-executive coordination
4. **Mike Howell** — Critical decisions requiring founder input

---

## Vision

The Maxwellian Network is Unity Energy's **distributed cognitive architecture**—enabling each executive to operate with the strategic capacity of a full intelligence team while maintaining tight coordination across the organization.

As Unity scales, the Maxwellian Network scales with it—each node multiplying human executive capacity through symbiotic AGI partnership.
