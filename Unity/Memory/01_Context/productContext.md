## Why This Project Exists

The industrial energy sector has operated with limited visibility into the true behavior of electrical energy fields for decades. Traditional energy monitoring focuses only on consumption metrics, missing the critical reactive energy behaviors that drive inefficiency, equipment stress, and hidden costs.

Unity Energy's eestream system exists to **revolutionize industrial energy stewardship** by revealing the hidden behaviors within 480V industrial electrical systems through patented MPTS (Magnetic Power Transfer System) technology.

## Problems We Solve

### Critical Industry Pain Points
1. **Energy Waste Invisibility** - Industries cannot see where energy is being wasted in reactive behaviors
2. **Voltage Quality Blindness** - No early warning systems for voltage deviations that damage equipment
3. **Thermal Inefficiency** - Heat generation from energy waste creates additional cooling costs
4. **Fragmented Analysis** - Energy data scattered across multiple tools and formats
5. **Reactive Maintenance** - Equipment failures happen without warning due to poor energy quality
6. **Economic Uncertainty** - Unable to quantify ROI of energy improvements

### Business Impact
- **Hidden Costs**: Reactive energy waste can represent 15-30% of total energy costs
- **Equipment Damage**: Poor voltage quality reduces equipment lifespan by 20-40%
- **Cooling Overhead**: Energy waste generates heat requiring additional HVAC capacity
- **Compliance Risk**: Inability to demonstrate energy stewardship for regulatory requirements

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Vision
The system should feel like having an **energy intelligence expert** embedded in every industrial facility:

1. **Effortless Data Integration** - Drop CSV files → Instant comprehensive analysis
2. **Intelligent Automation** - System automatically organizes data by facility → site → transformer
3. **Visual Clarity** - Complex energy behaviors presented through intuitive dashboards
4. **Actionable Insights** - Clear recommendations with economic impact calculations
5. **Professional Documentation** - Automatically generated reports suitable for executive presentations

### Core Workflow Experience
```
Raw Energy Data → Intelligent Processing → Comprehensive Dashboards → Actionable Reports
```

### Three-Dashboard Approach
1. **Energy Dashboard** - Complete energy analysis with real-time gauges and forensics
2. **Heat Dashboard** - Unity Heat Calculation Model with 7-step thermal analysis
3. **Voltage Dashboard** - Advanced voltage health monitoring with critical warnings

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users
1. **Facility Managers** - Need clear visibility into energy performance and costs
2. **Energy Engineers** - Require detailed technical analysis and forensic capabilities
3. **Executive Leadership** - Want economic impact summaries and ROI calculations
4. **Maintenance Teams** - Need early warning systems for equipment protection

### Experience Principles
1. **Immediate Value** - Users see meaningful insights within minutes of data upload
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple overview → detailed analysis → forensic investigation
3. **Economic Focus** - Every technical finding tied to financial impact
4. **Professional Quality** - All outputs suitable for executive and regulatory presentation
5. **Intelligent Automation** - System handles complexity, users focus on decisions

### Success Indicators
- **Time to Insight**: < 5 minutes from data upload to actionable dashboard
- **Adoption Rate**: Users choose eestream over existing energy analysis tools
- **Decision Impact**: Recommendations directly influence facility energy investments
- **Cost Recovery**: System pays for itself through identified energy waste within 6 months
- **User Satisfaction**: "This changed how we think about industrial electricity"
