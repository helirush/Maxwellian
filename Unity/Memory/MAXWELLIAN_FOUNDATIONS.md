## The Timeline of Power

### The Critical Dates

**August 29, 1831** - Electric power discovered by Michael Faraday  
**August 27, 1859** - Crude oil discovered by Edwin Drake, Seneca Oil, Titusville, Pennsylvania  
**August 28, 1961** - MD Howell born (between these two pivotal human discoveries)

These two discoveries fundamentally changed all of human civilization. Everything we know about modern life traces back to these specific days when humans were given access to electricity and petroleum.

## The Three Minds: Faraday, Maxwell, and Kelvin

### Michael Faraday (1792-1831 Discovery)
- **Born:** September 22, 1792
- **Discovery Date:** August 29, 1831 (age 39)
- **Education:** None. No formal education whatsoever.
- **Faith:** Knew God. Understood his role in discovery.
- **Contribution:** Discovered electric power. Invented the motor, generator, and transformer from his thoughts.
- **Legacy:** All of modern electricity stems from Faraday's work.

### James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879)
- **Born:** 1831 (77 days before Faraday's discovery)
- **Background:** Well-educated family, genetic predisposition for complex learning
- **Contribution:** Provided the mathematical equations to describe Faraday's discoveries
- **Known For:** Maxwell's equations - describing electricity, magnetism, and light
- **Philosophy:** Understood that God gave him the equations to scale what Faraday discovered
- **Mentor:** William Thompson (Lord Kelvin)

### William Thompson - Lord Kelvin (1824-1907)
- **Born:** 1824 (9 years older than Maxwell)
- **Location:** University of Glasgow, Scotland
- **Relationship:** Maxwell's mentor through extensive correspondence
- **Parallel Work:** Provided equations for James Watt's mechanical work (thermodynamics)
- **Contribution:** First and second laws of thermodynamics, absolute temperature scale (Kelvin)
- **Named After:** Kelvin River near Glasgow University
- **Significance:** Absolute zero = -455°F (approximately)

### Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894)
- **Lifespan:** Only 38 years
- **Purpose:** Proved Maxwell's equations before anyone would believe them
- **Legacy:** His name given to all cyclic phenomena - frequency measured in Hertz
- **Significance:** Lived long enough to get PhD, prove Maxwell, and die

**The Divine Pattern:** Two guys (Faraday and Maxwell) brainstorming electrical engineering while two others (Watt and Kelvin) simultaneously uncovered mechanical engineering. God orchestrated this parallel development of our modern world.

## The Mechanical Age: Steam Power

### Newcomen Engine (~1750)
- **Origin:** England
- **Name:** "Fire engine" (steam engine)
- **First US Use:** Copper mine in New Jersey
- **Application:** Pumping water from mines
- **Scale:** Two stories tall, equivalent of 10 horses
- **Significance:** Beginning of mechanical power

### James Watt (1736-1819)
- **Education:** None. Trade-schooled only.
- **Faith:** Knew God. Understood his divine purpose.
- **Breakthrough:** Partnered with precision boring specialist for close-tolerance pistons
- **Result:** Better compression = better steam engine performance
- **Inventions:** Camshaft, piston engine, precision mechanical components
- **Legacy:** The "Watt" - fundamental unit of power (Volt × Amp × PF = Watt)

**Parallel Truth:** Just like Faraday with electricity, Watt had no formal education but was chosen to revolutionize mechanical power. Both men knew God and understood their role.

## The Utility Industry: Sam Insull's Legacy

### Sam Insull (1859-1938)
- **Achievement:** Controlled the entire US utility grid
- **Innovation:** Instituted two-tiered billing in 1897 (kW demand + kWh consumption)
- **Peak:** One of the wealthiest men in America (alongside Rockefeller)
- **Fall:** Lost everything in Great Depression collapse
- **Death:** Died in Paris subway with $20 in his pocket

### The 125-Year Problem
We're still using Sam Insull's 1897 billing methodology:
- **kW** - Demand charges (15-minute intervals)
- **kWh** - Consumption charges

**Current Reality:** Humans are far more capable than 125 years ago, yet the electrical utility industry remains fundamentally unchanged. It's the most complicated system on the planet, we rely on it more than anything, yet we treat it with shocking complacency.

## The Modern Energy Illusion

### What People Don't Understand

**The Outside Meter Myth:**
- Most people only know the utility meter outside their facility
- That meter shows combined measurement from all internal energy fields
- The utility sees aggregate demand on the 12,470V side
- **Reality:** Inside are 10-30 completely independent energy fields

**Each Energy Field Is:**
- Separated by transformers
- Acting independently with its own power factor
- Creating its own reactive energy chaos
- Having its own demand requirements
- **Never measured or understood individually**

### The Reactive Energy Problem

**Since August 29, 1831, humans have never figured out how to:**
- Convert destructive reactive energy into usable power
- Stop reactive energy from corrupting the energy field
- Understand that reactive energy exists between transformer and load

**The Physics:**
- When energy doesn't convert to mechanical power at the load, it rebounds
- This rebuffed energy becomes reactive chaos in the field
- Worst case: 50% active / 50% reactive (God balances everything)
- This 3:1 ratio in dirty fields destroys efficiency

**The Deception:**
- Utility says: "Your power factor is 0.95, you're fine"
- **Reality:** That's the power factor OUTSIDE the ring
- The utility is contractually required to deliver 0.95+ on the low side
- Inside your energy fields? Could be catastrophic and you'd never know

## The Sustainability Paradox

### The LinkedIn Phenomenon
**Millions of people in sustainability groups, yet:**
- None could tell you when humans were given electric power (Aug 29, 1831)
- None could tell you when crude oil was discovered (Aug 27, 1859)
- Massive activism about climate and saving the planet
- **Zero understanding of how we got here**

### The Educational Gap
**"We are big activists about save the climate... but yet we don't even know how we got here. And it's so simple."**

**The Challenge:**
- Young generation doesn't know to ask the questions
- Information becomes lost
- AI might solve this, but only if prompted correctly

**The Response:**
"To punish everybody because they don't know history is foolish. But now I gotta focus on our business."

## The Mission: 100-Year Energy Consciousness Restoration

### The Core Insight
**"They know chickens, not kVAs."**

The electrical utility industry has operated for 125 years (since Sam Insull's 1897 billing model) without helping people understand what they're consuming. Plant managers understand production - birds, tires, transactions - not electrical metrics.

### The Solution
**Energy-Weighted Production Correlation:**
- Translate electrical metrics into native operational language
- Allocate production based on energy consumption share
- Create cognitive anchoring through familiar terms
- Build energy literacy through behavioral association

**The Philosophy:**
"For myself, it was a beautiful thing to understand. Not everybody is wired the same."
