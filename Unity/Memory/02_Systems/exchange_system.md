## 🔷 Purpose

This knowledge card defines Unity Energy's **Exchange System**—the intelligent layer that transforms industrial electrical infrastructure from passive consumption to active energy management. It connects high-resolution measurement, MPTS field optimization, and distributed energy resources into a unified, anticipatory system.

---

## 🧠 What is the Exchange System?

The Exchange System is Unity's **three-phase intelligent energy architecture**:

1. **Measure** - High-resolution field visibility through precision sensors
2. **Manage** - Real-time field optimization via MPTS systems
3. **Exchange** - Intelligent coordination with distributed energy resources (batteries, solar, grid)

> "Energy becomes more than a commodity. It becomes intelligence."

## 📊 Phase 1: Measure — Field Visibility

### Sensor Infrastructure
- **AccuVim precision meters** - High-resolution voltage, current, power quality monitoring
- **Waveform monitors** - Real-time harmonic and phase analysis
- **Thermal sensors** - Heat mapping of energy waste
- **Current transformers** - Per-circuit load profiling

### Data Intelligence Layer: eestream
The **eestream platform** transforms raw electrical data into actionable intelligence:

**eBehavior Module:**
- Processes high-resolution electrical field data
- Quantifies CO₂ waste from reactive energy
- Maps thermal hotspots from harmonic losses
- Calculates financial impact of field inefficiencies
- Performs forensic analysis of energy behaviors

**eVision Module:**
- Three-dashboard approach:
  - **Energy Dashboard** - kW/kVAR/kVA with real-time gauges and forensics
  - **Heat Dashboard** - 7-step Unity Heat Calculation Model
  - **Voltage Dashboard** - Power quality health monitoring with critical warnings

**Output:**
- "Measurement turns electricity from an expense into a story"
- Customers see their energy field for the first time
- Baseline established for optimization

## ⚡ Phase 2: Manage — Field Optimization

### MPTS Intelligent Field Processing
Once the field is revealed, **MPTS systems actively heal it**:

**Hardware Models:**
- **H120** - Light commercial / panel-level correction
- **H240** - 200 kVAR local correction (MCCs, pump clusters)
- **H490** - 400 kVAR field-dominant harmonic sink

**Operation:**
- **Copper-cored computers** - Think at the speed of light
- **Real-time waveform sensing** - Isolate reactive components
- **Field re-phasing** - Realign distorted energy in real-time
- **Waste extraction** - Subtract chaos rather than add correction energy

**Results:**
- 25-30% capacity reclamation (instantly)
- No rewiring, no downtime
- "The power was always there. It was just out of phase."

**Technical Principle:**
> "We're not correcting power factor. We're re-phasing the field itself."

Traditional systems **add energy** to fight distortion.  
Unity **subtracts**—we extract the waste.

## 🔄 Phase 3: Exchange — Distributed Intelligence

Once the field is stable, it can become **intelligent and bidirectional**.

### Waveform Anticipation
Unity links the optimized field to **distributed energy resources**:

**System Components:**
- Battery storage systems
- Solar arrays
- Grid interconnection
- Predictive load algorithms

**Operational Logic:**
1. **Demand spike detection** - System predicts load surge milliseconds before arrival
2. **Proactive injection** - Battery injects precise power to level the spike
3. **Grid harmony** - Utility sees smooth, predictable demand instead of chaos
4. **Demand redefinition** - Not demand response—demand **anticipation**

### Exchange System Benefits

**For Facilities:**
- Eliminates demand charge spikes
- Enables time-of-use arbitrage
- Provides backup resilience
- Reduces grid dependency

**For Utilities:**
- Gains megawatts of usable capacity without building new generation
- Stabilizes distribution network
- Reduces peak stress on transformers and substations
- "Capacity recovery without construction"

**For the Grid:**
> "Unity doesn't fight the grid. We teach it how to breathe."

## 💡 Core Principles

### 1. Energy as a Living System
- Not just hardware or software
- **Measures, manages, and exchanges** energy as if alive
- Continuous learning and adaptation

### 2. Anticipatory Intelligence
- Traditional: React to problems after they occur
- Unity: **Predict and prevent** field disturbances before they manifest

### 3. Subtraction Over Addition
