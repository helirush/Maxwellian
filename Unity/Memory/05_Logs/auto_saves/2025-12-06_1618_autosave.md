## Conversation Summary

**Recent Context:**
User (Mr. Howell) identified a critical vulnerability in the eMemory system: if Warp terminal crashes or is force-quit, conversation context is lost with no recovery mechanism. User expressed need for automatic memory capture to protect against unexpected terminations.

**Clerk's Response:**
Proposed implementing an auto-save memory system with three-layer protection:
1. Continuous background saves (every 5 messages)
2. Exit refinement prompt (user can curate)
3. Session archive (permanent storage)

---

## Detected Topics
- eMemory system vulnerability
- Auto-save architecture
- Session recovery mechanisms
- User experience design
- Terminal crash protection

---

## Files Touched
- `/Users/mdhowell/eestream/eMemory/02_Systems/auto_memory_system.md` (created)
- `/Users/mdhowell/eestream/eMemory/05_Logs/auto_saves/` (directory created)
- `/Users/mdhowell/eestream/eMemory/05_Logs/sessions/` (directory created)

---

## Code Generated
None (documentation-focused session)

---

## Decisions Made
1. **Adopt three-layer auto-save architecture** for eMemory
2. **Store auto-saves in 05_Logs/auto_saves/** for recovery
3. **Store finalized sessions in 05_Logs/sessions/** for permanent archive
4. **Keep last 3 auto-saves** to balance recovery vs disk space
5. **Maintain exit prompt** so user can refine/tag before final save
6. **Auto-save frequency: 5 messages or 10 minutes** (whichever comes first)

---

## System Changes
- Created new eMemory system documentation: `auto_memory_system.md`
- Established directory structure for auto-saves and sessions
- Defined metadata formats for both recovery and finalized sessions

---

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement Python script for auto-save manager or rely on Warp/Clerk native capabilities?
2. What's the ideal balance between auto-save frequency and performance?
3. Should cloud backup be part of Phase 1 or Phase 2?
4. How should multi-agent sessions be handled (Clerk + Codex working together)?

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update Clerk's rules to enable auto-save behavior
- [ ] Test crash recovery with sample session
- [ ] Create config file template for user preferences
- [ ] Document recovery procedures for team

## Full Recent Transcript

**User:** "Not sure... What do we do in the event that the Terminal with all the Tabs get terminated... is there any recourse at that point?"

**Clerk:** "Great question—this highlights a real vulnerability in the current setup. If the Terminal/Warp crashes or gets force-quit:
- Any conversation threads that were open but not yet saved to eMemory are lost
- There's no automatic backup or recovery mechanism
- We lose that context forever unless you manually captured it before the crash..."

[Additional context would be captured here in full implementation]

**Recovery Note:** This auto-save can be used to resume work or review what was being discussed if terminal crashes.
