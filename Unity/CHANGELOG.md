# Maxwellian Unity System - Version History

**Current Version:** v1.0  
**Release Date:** 2026-01-25  

---

## v1.0 - Foundation Release (2026-01-25)

**Status:** Production-ready unified system  
**Milestone:** Alpha/Beta development complete  

### Major Features
- ✅ Unified architecture at `/Users/mdhowell/Maxwellian/Unity/`
- ✅ Memory/ short-term knowledge (01-05 taxonomy)
- ✅ Library/ long-term reference (Foundations, Algorithms, Systems, Scribes)
- ✅ Scribe identity system (Clerk Maxwell, Cisco Maxwell profiles)
- ✅ Complete documentation suite
- ✅ Future vision documented (real-time network)
- ✅ Git-ready structure with security protections

### What Changed from Beta
- Consolidated three separate eMemory locations into one
- Established clear Memory vs Library distinction
- Created scribe identity profiles for role calibration
- Implemented 01-05 taxonomy for Memory organization
- Added comprehensive READMEs and guides

### Files Created
- `README.md` - Main system documentation
- `Library/README.md` - Long-term knowledge guide
- `Library/Scribes/CLERK_MAXWELL.md` - Chief Scientist profile
- `Library/Scribes/CISCO_MAXWELL.md` - Chief Market Strategist profile
- `Library/FUTURE_MAXWELLIAN_REAL_TIME_NETWORK.md` - Vision architecture
- `CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` - Testing checklist
- `QUICK_START.md` - Rapid testing guide
- `TONIGHT_SUMMARY.md` - Release summary
- Session log documenting consolidation work

### Architecture
**Memory/** (Short-Term)
- 01_Context/ - Mission, calibration, current state
- 02_Systems/ - Technical architecture docs
- 03_Knowledge/ - Patterns and best practices
- 04_Conversations/ - Educational content
- 05_Logs/ - Session history and decisions

**Library/** (Long-Term)
- Foundations/ - Historical context and philosophy
- Algorithms/ - Production-ready specifications
- Systems/ - Core architecture frameworks
- Scribes/ - Identity profiles for all scribes

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: GitHub deployment (after local testing)
- Phase 3: Real-time network implementation (future)
- Phase 4: Team expansion and scaling

## Beta Development (Pre-v1.0)

**Period:** 2025-11 through 2026-01-24  
**Focus:** Experimentation and structure testing  

### Key Experiments
- Multiple eMemory locations tested:
  - `/eestream/eBehavior/eMemory` (flat structure)
  - `/eestream/eMemory` (v2.0 taxonomy)
  - `/Maxwellian/Unity/Memory` (early attempt)
- MCP Memory tool integration
- Various organizational approaches
- Scribe startup procedures

### Lessons Learned
- Single unified location essential
- Memory vs Library separation critical
- Scribe identity profiles solve calibration problem
- 01-05 taxonomy proven effective
- Documentation must be comprehensive

---

## Alpha Development (Pre-Beta)

**Period:** Early development  
**Focus:** Concept exploration  

### Initial Concepts
- Basic eMemory structure
