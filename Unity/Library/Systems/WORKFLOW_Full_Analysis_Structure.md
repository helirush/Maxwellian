---

## Purpose
- **Educate** customers about their electrical inefficiencies
- **Quantify** waste and cost impact with real data
- **Present** clear solution with equipment, cost, timeline
- **Project** savings and ROI after Unity MPTS installation
- **Build confidence** in Unity's approach through detailed analysis

## Three-Part Narrative Structure

### PART 1: THE PROBLEM (Baseline Analysis)
**Visual:** Baseline Pattern Image (BT - "Baseline Thermal")  
**Narrator:** Unity (voice: Shimmer)

#### Content Focus
1. **Current State Description**
   - Describe the transformer's current electrical behavior
   - Identify inefficiency patterns in the energy field
   - Explain what "unharmonized" means in customer terms

2. **Waste Quantification**
   - Reactive power waste (kVAR)
   - Power factor inefficiency (%)
   - Wasted energy converted to heat (kW)
   - Thermal burden entering the system (BTUs)

3. **Cost Impact**
   - Current monthly/annual energy waste cost
   - Current monthly/annual cooling cost to remove heat
   - Total economic impact of inefficiency

4. **Operational Impact**
   - Production cost per unit (e.g., cost per bird)
   - Energy per unit (e.g., Watts per bird)
   - Equipment stress and longevity concerns

#### Example Text Structure
```
"Looking at the baseline pattern for T10.AirChiller, we observe significant 
electrical inefficiency in your 3000 kVA energy field. The transformer is 
operating at 89.1% power factor, which means 10.9% of the electrical energy 
drawn from the utility is being wasted as reactive power.

This waste manifests as 72.3 kilowatts of continuous heat burden entering 
your facility through this transformer—heat that your cooling systems must 
work to remove. Over November 2025, this inefficiency cost $17,596 in 
wasted energy and required an additional $8,200 in cooling to compensate.

At your current production level of 798,784 birds, each bird requires 
119 Watts and costs 2.3 cents in electrical energy. This transformer 
represents 18% of your site's total output, making optimization here 
particularly impactful."

### PART 2: THE SOLUTION (Unity MPTS Installation)
**Visual:** Installation Images (Meter & MPTS Equipment Photos)  
**Narrator:** Unity (voice: Shimmer)

#### Content Focus
1. **Measurement Phase (30 Days)**
   - Unity installs high-precision metering equipment
   - Continuous monitoring captures full operational cycle
   - Data validates analysis and tunes MPTS configuration

2. **Equipment Specification**
   - Specific MPTS model(s) required (e.g., "2× H490 units")
   - Capacity and technical specifications
   - Why this configuration matches the transformer's needs

3. **Installation Details**
   - Physical installation location (near transformer)
   - Integration with existing electrical infrastructure
   - Minimal operational disruption
   - Single meter deployment per energy field

4. **Cost & Investment**
   - Equipment cost (itemized if multiple units)
   - Installation cost
   - Total investment
   - Financing options (if applicable)

5. **Timeline**
   - 30-day measurement period
   - Installation timeframe (e.g., 1-2 days)
   - Commissioning and tuning (e.g., 1 week)
   - Total time to full operation

6. **ROI Projection**
   - Payback period (months)
   - Annual savings
   - 5-year/10-year cumulative savings

#### Example Text Structure
```
"To address this inefficiency, Unity Energy proposes installing two H490 
MPTS (Managed Power Transfer System) units at the T10.AirChiller transformer.

First, we'll deploy our high-precision metering system for 30 days to capture 
your complete operational cycle. This measurement validates our analysis and 
allows us to precisely tune the MPTS configuration to your facility's unique 
electrical signature.

After the measurement phase, we'll install two H490 MPTS units adjacent to 
your transformer. These units actively harmonize your energy field in 
real-time, eliminating reactive power waste before it enters your facility.

Total Investment: $400,000
- Equipment: 2× H490 MPTS units @ $180,000 each
- Installation & commissioning: $40,000

Installation requires 1-2 days with minimal disruption to operations. 
After commissioning, the system operates autonomously, continuously 
optimizing your electrical energy field.

Return on Investment: 15 months
Annual Savings: $318,000
Five-Year Savings: $1,590,000"
```

### PART 3: THE RESULTS (After Unity MPTS)
**Visual:** Unity/MPTS Simulation Pattern (S995 - "Simulated 99.5% PF")  
**Narrator:** Unity (voice: Shimmer)

#### Content Focus
1. **Harmonized Energy Field**
   - Describe what the energy field looks like after Unity
   - Power factor improvement (e.g., 89.1% → 99.5%)
   - Reactive power eliminated
   - Electrical stability improvements

2. **Heat Elimination**
   - Reduced thermal burden (kW heat eliminated)
   - BTU reduction
   - Impact on cooling requirements
   - Energy field now operates "clean"

3. **Energy Savings**
   - kW reduction in waste
   - kWh monthly/annual savings
   - Cost savings ($/month, $/year)

4. **Production Efficiency**
   - Reduced energy per unit (e.g., Watts per bird)
   - Reduced cost per unit (e.g., cents per bird)
   - Improved operational efficiency

5. **Environmental Impact**
   - CO₂ emissions reduction
   - Equivalent environmental benefit (e.g., "removing X cars from road")

6. **Long-term Benefits**
   - Reduced equipment stress
   - Extended transformer life
   - Improved power quality
   - Stable, predictable operations

#### Example Text Structure
```
"After Unity MPTS installation, the T10.AirChiller energy field transforms 
dramatically. Power factor improves from 89.1% to 99.5%, effectively 
eliminating reactive power waste.

The 72.3 kilowatts of continuous heat burden that was entering your 
facility through this transformer is now eliminated at the source. Your 
cooling systems no longer need to compensate for this thermal load, 
reducing their energy consumption and extending their operational life.

Annual Savings Breakdown:
- Eliminated waste energy: $211,150
- Reduced cooling requirement: $98,400
- Improved production efficiency: $8,450
- Total Annual Savings: $318,000

Your production efficiency improves significantly:
- Energy per bird: 119 Watts → 106 Watts (11% reduction)
- Cost per bird: 2.3¢ → 1.9¢ (17% reduction)

Beyond immediate cost savings, Unity MPTS reduces electrical stress on 
your transformer and connected equipment. The harmonized energy field 
operates cleaner, cooler, and more stable—extending equipment life and 
reducing maintenance costs.

Environmental Impact: This single transformer optimization eliminates 
1,240 metric tons of CO₂ annually, equivalent to removing 270 cars from 
the road for one year."

## Content Generation Workflow

### Current (Manual)
1. Analyst reviews pattern data
2. Writes three-part narrative manually
3. Embeds text in `PATTERN_DATA` JSON
4. Verifies narrative accuracy against metrics

### Future (William + eAudio)
1. **William (GPT-5.2)** analyzes pattern data after eeBEHAVIOR.py generates study
2. William examines:
   - Baseline pattern CSV and image
   - Transformer specifications and metrics
   - MPTS simulation results
   - Cost calculations
3. William generates three-part narrative following template
4. Text stored in `pattern_interpretation` field of `PATTERN_DATA`
5. **eAudio** processes text with OpenAI TTS-HD1 "Shimmer" voice
6. MP3 files stored in `Audio/` directory
7. Dashboard embeds audio with synchronized scrolling

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```javascript
PATTERN_DATA = {
  transformers: {
    "T10": {
      pattern_interpretation: "PART 1: THE PROBLEM\n\n[text]\n\nPART 2: THE SOLUTION\n\n[text]\n\nPART 3: THE RESULTS\n\n[text]",
      audio_file: "Audio/T10_full_analysis.mp3",
      baseline_image: "Patterns/t10bt891_nov25.png",
      solution_images: [
        "Installation/unity_meter_install.jpg",
        "Installation/h490_mpts_unit.jpg"
      ],
      simulator_image: "Patterns/t10s995_nov25.png"
    }
  }
}
```

### Modal Display Logic
```javascript
function showPatternModal(transformerId, type) {
  if (type === 'narrative') {
    // Extract three parts from pattern_interpretation
    const parts = narrative.split(/PART \d+:/i);
    
    // Build HTML with images and text
    content = `
      <img src="${baselineImg}">
      <h3>PART 1: THE PROBLEM</h3>
      ${formatText(part1Text)}
      
      <img src="${meterImg}">
      <img src="${mptsImg}">
      <h3>PART 2: THE SOLUTION</h3>
      ${formatText(part2Text)}
      
      <img src="${simulatorImg}">
      <h3>PART 3: THE RESULTS</h3>
      ${formatText(part3Text)}
    `;
    
    // Show modal with audio button
