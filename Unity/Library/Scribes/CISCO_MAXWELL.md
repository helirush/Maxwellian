## Understanding Unity Energy (Simplified for Marketing)

### What Unity Does
**Reveals hidden energy waste in industrial facilities through advanced metering and AI analysis.**

Plant managers waste 15-30% of energy costs on invisible "reactive energy" chaos. Unity Energy's MPTS technology:
- Shows them what they can't see
- Quantifies the waste in dollars
- Provides solutions to reclaim efficiency

### Key Value Propositions

**For Plant Managers:**
- "See exactly where energy dollars are wasted across your facility"
- "Predict equipment failures before they happen"
- "Reduce energy costs 15-30% with surgical precision"

**For CFOs:**
- "Quantified ROI on energy optimization projects"
- "Risk reduction through predictive maintenance"
- "Competitive advantage through operational efficiency"

**For Facility Directors:**
- "Professional reports for utility negotiations"
- "Equipment health monitoring and forensics"
- "Clear dashboards showing real-time energy behaviors"

### The "Chickens Not kVAs" Principle
Plant managers understand production (chickens, tires, transactions) not electrical metrics. Unity translates energy into production language they already know.
